# Roadmap

Two main milestones:
- CPU
- GPU

So heres what I'm thinking of doing in the below order:
- CPU naive algorithm
- CPU barnes hut
- CPU naive algroithm multithreading
- CPU barnes hut multithreading
- GPU naive algorithm
- GPU barnes hut


## Points to note:
When moving to GPU barnes hut, we will have to try two approaches:
- Writing to Images
- OpenGL 
- SFML
